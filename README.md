# Michael-Cook-Spring_Conversion
basic Java app with endpoints to do conversions

 Accepts JSON for all input data for the endpoints in following format
 {
     Value: double
     Unit: String
 }
  all data is returned in the same JSON format

to run the part1 
./mvnw spring-boot:run

testing as excluded due to timelimit

The program was done in simple as possible way due to time limit.

part 2 was believed to not include the in the time and thus done before hand and added to the program afterwards in its part2 folder in one .java file.
